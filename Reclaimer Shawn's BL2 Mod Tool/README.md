# Known Glitches
These glitches are entirely due to how the game works and not the tool itself. I cannot fix these glitches and I doubt anyone else will be able to either. Anyways, here are the glitches:
* For others to be able to properly join your game, first enable the cheats and then start up a game. Then, let them join your game in progress. If you try starting a game with other people online instead of having them joining in progress, your console will freeze but their consoles won't.
* Before joining a game yourself, you'll need to revert your character to Level 72 or under using Gibbed's Save Editor. Otherwise, you won't be allowed to join people's games as your level is way over the maximum. The level mod doesn't keep others from joining your game, though.

# Online Use
The cheats only work if you're host. If you're not host, none of them work. If you are host, all of the cheats work for you and some work for other people. These are the following cheats that work for other people:
* Infinite Currency works sporadically for others. Seems to possibly happen whenever they receive money or buy/sell an item. Though, this may not immediately happen and take several minutes of game play.
* Infinite HP and Insta-Kill works for all players when you're the host.
