# Proper Installation and Usage Instructions
1) For this tool to work properly, go to the directory that contains your RE: ORC files and follow this directory: RE ORC/dlc/pack1/characters There are some files you'll need to copy. Make a copy of the following files:
* lupo.ssg
* lupo-hr.ssg
* hunk.ssg
* hunk-hr.ssg
* leon.ssg
* leon-hr.ssh
* ubcs.ssg
* ubcs-hr.ssg
* spook.ssg
* spook-hr.ssg
* deeay.ssg
* deeay-hr.ssg
* shona.ssg
* shona-hr.ssg
* tweed.ssg
* tweed-hr.ssg
* vector.ssg
* vector-hr.ssg
* harley.ssg
* harley-hr.ssg
* hunter.ssg
* hunter-hr.ssg
* licker.ssg
* licker-hr.ssg
* tyrant.ssg
* tyrant-hr.ssg
* willow.ssg
* willow-hr.ssg
* beltway.ssg
* beltway-hr.ssg
* adawong.ssg
* adawong-hr.ssg
* gbirkin.ssg
* gbirkin-hr.ssg
* nemesis.ssg
* nemesis-hr.ssg
* specops.ssg
* specops-hr.ssg
* foureyes.ssg
* foureyes-hr.ssg
* lonewolf.ssg
* lonewolf-hr.ssg
* parasite.ssg
* parasite-hr.ssg

2) Now, name these copies accordingly.
Rename lupo.ssg to lupu.ssg and lupo-hr.ssg to lupu-hr.ssg
Basically, you just take the last character before -hr or .ssg and make it a u instead. This is done because if we didn't rename the files, the model would appear invisible in-game.

3) Then, place these files back in the directory you got them from (RE ORC/dlc/pack1/characters)

4) You should also see a characters.swb2 file in that directory. Make a copy of it, then place that copy in the same file folder the Model Swap Tool is in.

5) Open the Model Swap tool and make your changes.

6) Finally, place the characters.swb2 file back in the RE ORC/dlc/pack1/characters directory. Your changes should be saved!
