# Known Glitches
These glitches might be fixable if I did more work on the function I made to do this. I'm not working on these:
* Insta-Kill sometimes causes enemies to go invisible, stay on the map, and not actually die when they're killed. I don't recommend using it.
* Invincible might cause you to instantly die to enemies like G-Birkin, at least on online play. Haven't seen this on offline play.

# Online Use
The cheats only work if you're host. If you are host, all of the cheats work for you and some work for other people. These are the following cheats that work for other people:
* Primary/Secondary Weapon Modification
* Invincibility/Insta-Kill
