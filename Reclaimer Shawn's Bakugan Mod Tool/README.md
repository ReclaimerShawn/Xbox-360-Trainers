# Known Glitches
* Selecting a Bakugan that doesn't match with its attribute (EX: Haos Dragonoid) will a "Dummy Data" sprite instead of the ball model or the picture in-game. Mismatched Bakugan will also have black sprites. I view this a feature, not a bug due to how cool it looks, but this is due to how the game works.
* Viewing Naga's ball model causes the game to crash. I do not know how to get around this in battle other than by file editing the game.
