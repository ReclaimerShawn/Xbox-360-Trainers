# Xbox 360 Trainers
These are tools I've made for Single Player games and Co-Op games. I prefer not to ruin online play for competitive games, so I won't develop anything for those games.
Whenever I make something for a Co-Op game, please don't use my tools online to negatively affect the gameplay of others. These tools are meant to enhance the experience of these games, not to make them worse.

# Setup
You'll need to have Xbox 360 Neighborhood to use these tools. Make sure you set the console you want to use these tools on to the Default Console in Neighborhood or these tools won't connect.
You'll also need xbdm.xex and XRPC.xex as plugins on Dashlaunch. If you're using RGLoader or an XDK, you'll just need XRPC.xex as a plugin

# VirusTotal Scans:
Resident Evil 4 exe file: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/1454b38c51307a72cd0fc67e0744cdf5a2953fb122d154a644de6abc24ea4295?nocache=1

# Compiling
I've included the Source Code of these tools so they can be compiled or looked over to make sure they don't contain malicious code. 
If you want to compile these tools, simply open the Solution in Visual Studio Professional 2010. Then add the included xdevkit.dll as a reference. After that, you should be able to compile the tools.

# Takedowns
If you are the Game developer my tool is affected by, the Publisher, or Microsoft and you want me to take my tool down, simply file an issue in the Github and I'll take it down promptly. No need to C&D or sue me.
