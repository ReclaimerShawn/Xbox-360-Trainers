# Xbox 360 Trainers
These are tools I've made for Single Player games and Co-Op games. I prefer not to ruin online play for competitive games, so I won't develop anything for those games. They all require a modified console or a devkit to use.
Whenever I make something for a Co-Op game, please don't use my tools online to negatively affect the gameplay of others. These tools are meant to enhance the experience of these games, not to make them worse.

# Setup
You'll need to have Xbox 360 Neighborhood to use these tools. Make sure you set the console you want to use these tools on to the Default Console in Neighborhood or these tools won't connect.
You'll also need xbdm.xex and XRPC.xex as plugins on Dashlaunch. If you're using RGLoader or an XDK, you'll just need XRPC.xex as a plugin

# Compilation Instructions
1) To compile these files from the source code .7z archives, open the .sln file inside the WindowsFormsApplication# folder in Visual Studio 2010 Professional.
2) Find a copy of xdevkit.dll somewhere online (I'm not including this file) and add it as a reference to the tool.
3) Build the tool and run the exe file.

# Takedowns
This is a note for the Developers and Publishers of the games of the tools I published here. This is also a note for Microsoft as well. If you want me to remove these tools, tell me what tool to remove by posting an Issue in this Github repository and I'll remove it promptly. You could also attempt contacting me via my email epiczombie7@gmail.com, but I rarely ever check this email and receieve a lot of spam in my inbox, so contacting me on the Github is a better idea.
