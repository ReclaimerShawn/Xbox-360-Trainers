# Proper Installation
This tool has the ability to select DLC characters in the Campaign mode of the game.
If you don't follow these instructions, selecting DLC characters will crash the game and likely the console.
The game won't crash if you select non-DLC characters, though.

1) Install the LOST IN NIGHTMARES AND DESPERATE ESCAPE DLC files onto your USB.
2) Create a folder called nativeXenon on your computer
3) Open the DLC package files in wxPirs-1.1 and extract all files and folders for both packages to the nativeXenon folder.
4) Place the nativeXenon folder in the same directory as your Resident Evil 5 game. This is only possible if your game is in .XEX format

# Program Quirks
* If you don't click Enable Tool before use, the tool won't work. You click Connect and then click Enable Tool after the tool connects and it'll work properly.
* The item modifier only works if you fire your gun/item once before selecting options. It uses the ammo counter to find the item address. So, before using it, fire the gun you want to change first. If Sheva fires her gun and she's an AI character, it'll find/modify whatever gun she was using whenever she fired.
* The character editor may take changing the chapter, saving, and exiting a few times before your characters are actually changed.

# Online Use
The cheats only work if you're host. Here are some notes about online use with this tool:
* Item Editor works. Have the player fire a gun and then change the gun. Tell them not to fire the gun again until they enter a door, otherwise, the gun will revert back to normal. Then walk through a door and their item will change to the one of your choice and have whatever options you gave it (Infinite Ammo, Damage Mod, Rapid Fire).
* The character editor works online but the skin modifier doesn't. As a result, be sure to tell players to set their skins to the default BSAA skin before joining, otherwise, their game might crash. Also, modified characters cannot open certain doors online, rendering it impossible to progress further in the game. This doesn't happen offline.
* Unlike what the tool says, using DLC characters doesn't crash the player's game online. I got someone to finally test it with me and it worked properly.
