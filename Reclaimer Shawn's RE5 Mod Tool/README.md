# Proper Installation
This tool has the ability to select DLC characters in the Campaign mode of the game.
If you don't follow these instructions, selecting DLC characters will crash the game and likely the console.
The game won't crash if you select non-DLC characters, though.

1) Install the LOST IN NIGHTMARES AND DESPERATE ESCAPE DLC files onto your USB.
2) Create a folder called nativeXenon on your computer
3) Open the DLC package files in wxPirs-1.1 and extract all files and folders for both packages to the nativeXenon folder.
4) Place the nativeXenon folder in the same directory as your Resident Evil 5 game. This is only possible if your game is in .XEX format

# Known Glitches
* If you don't click Enable Tool before using any of the cheats, the tool won't work. Push the button.
* The character editor may take changing the chapter, saving and exiting a few times before your characters are actually changed.

# NOTICE
Don't select DLC characters online with other players unless they have a modded console and their copy of RE5 has the nativeXenon files placed in the game directory. Otherwise, their games may crash on loading.
