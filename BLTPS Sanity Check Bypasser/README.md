# Potential Glitches
I say this glitch is potential because I haven't been able to test this with anyone online. If I had someone test this with me, I could confirm or deny this glitch. If this glitch is present, it's entirely due to how the game works and not the tool itself. Anyways, here's the glitch:
* For others to be able to properly join your game, first enable the cheats and then start up a game. Then, let them join your game in progress. If you try starting a game with other people online instead of having them joining in progress, your console will freeze but their consoles won't.
