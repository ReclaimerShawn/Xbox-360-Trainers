# Known Glitches
These glitches are entirely due to how the game works and not the tool itself. I cannot fix these glitches and I doubt anyone else will be able to either. If there is a fix, it'd involve editing game files and animations. Anyways, here are the glitches:
* Characters other than Leon may not be able to finish a level, as all characters don't have animations to do things like jump over certain obstacles.
* Characters other than Leon crash whenever you look in your inventory by pressing the Start button. To be able to access your inventory, buy an item from the Merchant if you really need to organize your inventory.
* Characters other than Leon crash the game if you save with them. This also makes it impossible to load that particular save file. Setting the character to Leon before the save occurs circumvents this crash.
* Wesker and HUNK's melee attacks crash the game.
* Ashley can die with the Infinite HP cheat if you hit her with a Rocket Launcher and she doesn't have Knight Armor on.
