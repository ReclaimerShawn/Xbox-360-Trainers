# Known Glitches
* Characters other than Leon crash the second you have a radio transmission. This made to work by cheaters like Ralf on the Gamecube by disabling radio transmission, but I have no idea to make this cheat myself. If someone could help me with this, I'd highly appreciate it.
* Characters other than Leon may not be able to finish a level, as all characters don't have animations to do things like jump over certain obstacles.
* Characters other than Leon crash the game if you complete the level with them and save. This also makes it impossible to load that particular save file.
* Wesker and HUNK's melee attacks crash the game.
* Ashley can die with the Infinite HP cheat if you hit her with a Rocket Launcher and she doesn't have Knight Armor on.
