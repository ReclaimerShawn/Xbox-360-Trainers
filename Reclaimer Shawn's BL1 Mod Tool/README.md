# Known Glitches (Due to Borderlands itself and not the tool)
* Using the Infinite Skill Points option prevents you from loading into the game. Disable the cheat until you get into the game.
* Setting yourself to Level 2147483647 breaks the ability of vehicles to fire weapons. Any Level over 100 does this, hence why I added a Level 100 option to the tool.
* The game may randomly crash when using Invincibility or Insta-Kill. This is unlikely to happen, just know it can. Also, it seems as if using either of these options sometimes causes graphical glitches on enemy models. It's odd but doesn't actually affect gameplay.
* For others to be able to properly join your game, first enable the cheats and then start up a game. Then, let them join your game in progress. If you try starting a game with other people online instead of having them joining in progress, your console will freeze but their consoles won't.

# Online Use
The cheats only work if you're host. If you're not host, none of them work. If you are host, all of the cheats work for you and some work for other people. These are the following cheats that work for other people:
* Infinite Skill Points
* Invincibility
* Infinite Ammo
* The Level modifier, but only on their vehicles and not the players themselves.
