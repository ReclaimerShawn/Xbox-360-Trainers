# Proper Installation
This tool's inventory editor doesn't work unless you have all weapons in the game on your save file for each character. To allow this tool to work properly, take the save included with this tool and Rehash/Resign it to your profile. It has all of the weapons unlocked. Thanks to Yecgaa01 for the save file!

# Known Glitches
* Before you reload at a checkpoint, items that are edited will appear to be their original items. If you use these items before reloading a checkpoint, the game may crash. To get around this, just use your horizontal weapons and not your vertical weapons until you reload the checkpoint. After the guns have been properly updated, you'll be fine. 

# Online Use
This hasn't been tested online yet. It will be.
